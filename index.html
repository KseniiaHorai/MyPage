                        Personally, I love numbers and structure, so here are my
                        3 specific reasons why I would choose Techstack over any
                        other company:

                    <p class="section-content">
                        It didn’t take me too long to realize that the most
                        valuable asset of <b>Techstack</b> is <b>people</b>. Who
                        doesn’t want to study and work at a company where the
                        employees are always <b>respected and supported</b> in
                        whatever they are trying to achieve? Being around
                        <b>smart, hard-working and supportive</b> people has
                        been my number one priority when it comes to looking for
                        a job or trying to get an internship. Based on the posts
                        and videos of your employees on your
                        <b>social media</b>, Techstack would be the perfect
                        place for me to experience that.

                    <p class="section-content">
                        The second most important part of any tech company is of
                        course its <b>completed projects</b> as they are the
                        best <b>indicator of success in the future</b>. Although
                        the <b>case study</b> section on your website is full of
                        interesting apps and solutions there is one that really
                        stuck out to me. It may not be as groundbreaking as the
                        <b
                            >solar energy production platform or the software
                            for analyzing heart rate data</b
                        >
                        but it still caught my attention. It’s your older
                        project -
                        <b>the Mobile Social Network for Sports Fans</b>. As
                        <b>an avid table tennis player</b>
                        I could really use a dedicated app where I would be able
                        to connect with other ping-pong aficionados. :) Hope one
                        day I’ll be able to create a similar platform myself.

                    <p class="section-content">
                        I think that it’s absolutely amazing that Techstack
                        offers <b>so many internship programs all the time</b>.
                        It can be so hard to find the first job for
                        <b>a developer who’s just starting out</b> and the team
                        at Techstack seems to perfectly understand that. I know
                        that you’ve had many <b>other internships</b> in the
                        <b>past</b> and will probably hold a lot more in the
                        <b>future</b>. Even if I don’t get this internship I
                        know that I will <b>hone my skills and apply again</b>.
